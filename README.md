# Software Team

Areas of focus:

- Computer Vision
- Controllers
- Data analytics
- Front End UI/UX

## Goals
1. Familiarity with OpenCV image processing 
2. Experience creating custom Arduino libraries in C++
3. Knowledge of K-NN, linear classifiers, and other basic ML concepts
4. Ability to code quickly in Python


## Python Tasks
- Download Python
- Open [this file](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1184/1184-0.txt) and display contents to the terminal line by line
- Read in an argument from the command line and print it. (ex. `./python printtest.py falcon9` will print `falcon9`)
- Check if a file exists - if not, create it
- Open a file and write to it
- Write a function `def countdown( start )` which takes an `int` value and decrements that `int` once per second. Meanwhile, print the current value to terminal. At zero, print `We have liftoff`.

For [this data](http://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/coord/b29root.dat):
- Return an array of all (float, float) values in the list, removing all whitespaces and header info 
- Plot on an XY plane (hint: import matlibplot.pyplot as plt). [Result]("http://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/afplots/b29root.gif")

Notes: You can choose to download the files and place them in the same directory as your python file, or you can use the urllib2 library to obtain the files from the url during runtime
